        <p>You would think when their was a worldwide lockdown, restaurants would have found the time to shape up and clean up. Yet, in the years during and right after COVID, restaurants in Pearl River, New York faced the most critical violations.</p>

        
    <p>According to 

        <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/rii/blue-book.pdf"> <i><strong>What to Expect When You're Inspected:A Guide for Food Service Operators</i></strong>,</a> "Critical violations are (violations) that are more likely than general ones to contribute to food-borne illnesses because they may be a substantial risk to the public’s health.”

<p>These type of violations give more points against a restaurant than general violation as they are more severe. 

<p>According to 

        <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/rii/blue-book.pdf"> <i><strong>What to Expect When You're Inspected:A Guide for Food Service Operators</i></strong>,</a> an example of a critical violation is “failure to cook foods at their required temperatures” while a general one would be “failure to provide an accurate thermometer in a refrigerator.”<p>

<p>Between 2005 and 2024, multiple critical violations were found in food service establishments in Pearl River, New York. Out of the 2973 food establishments there were 354 critical violations with the most common infringement appearing 86 times: “Potentially hazardous foods are not stored under refrigeration except during necessary preparation or approved pre-cooling procedures (room temperature storage).”<p>

<p>This data also includes 19 Schools K-12 Food Services, and only one school had a critical violation. The  Pearl River Middle School had 2 critical violations on October 3rd 2023. This shows that it is about 6 times more likely to have no critical violations versus having 2 critical violations in school k-12 food service. The Middle School disobeyed “Potentially hazardous foods are not kept at or above 140°F during hot holding.”
<p>

<p>Other popular critical violations that were commonly found in all of the data include:
“Potentially hazardous foods are not kept at or below 45°F during cold holding, except smoked fish not kept at or below 38°F during cold holding” and “Accurate thermometers not available or used to evaluate potentially hazardous food temperatures during cooking, cooling, reheating and holding.” These violations each occurred a little over 30 times.<p> 

<p>All in all, 22 different critical violations were found throughout the 353 violations noted. These violations include food not being stored properly and at correct temperatures, unclean procedures when touching food, toxic chemicals not properly stored creating food and surface contamination, broken or cracked utensils and plated,and water and sewage leakage.<p>

<p>But this data illustrated that these critical violations took place the most during the COVID-19 pandemic and the years following the pandemic. There was a 300 percent increase in critical violations from 2018-2019 to 2023-2024 and the most critical violations were in the year 2022, around when COVID was starting to reach its downfall. <p>

<p>But we can also assume that there were so many more violations during this time because there is a likelihood that the Covid-19 pandemic increased the amount of inspections that had to take place. In 2024 there was almost a 12% increase in the amount of health inspections in food services in 2024 compared to the amount in 2020. <p>

<p>We can hypothesize that COVID-19  made the amount of inspections go up because new protocols were put into place, inspectors needed to make up for the inspections they couldn't perform during the pandemic, and diners want to feel safe where they chose to eat after suffering through the pandemic. <p>

<p>This information surprised Sydney Zweibach, a Pearl River resident. Zweibach was not aware that restaurant violations were public information as she thought since it creates bad publicity for restaurants that it would be public, but now that she is aware of this information, it will play a role in where she eats going forward.<p>

<p> “I would not want to go to a restaurant that has food violations because I would not want to get sick or eat contaminated food. I would also want a restaurant to be clean for the most part and have nice staff,” Zweibach said. “Going forward this definitely impacts my decision on eating at a restaurant, but certain violations would have larger impacts than others. I would be more concerned about clean food than floors that are dirty.”<p>

<p>Addison Lennon, another Pearl River resident, agreed with Zweibach.<p>

<p> “ If I heard that a restaurant had multiple violations of health codes I would immediately look the restaurant up to see what has happened,” Lennon said. “If I look it up and it is true I am 100% not going there, even if it wasn’t true I still wouldn’t go because the rumors of violations is enough for me to not want to go.”<p>

<p>This illustrates that so many of our go-to restaurants have not even general, but critical violations, against them, yet consumer’s aren’t aware and didn’t know that violations were public information. Knowing this now, allows restaurant diners to decide if they still want to go back to their favorite local places on Main Street.</p>

<p>But apart from critical, some Food Service Establishments also face both critical and noncritical violations. When inspected on August 18th, 2022, local Pearl River ice cream shop, King Kone, was charged with both critical( Canned foods found in poor conditions-leakers, severe dents, rusty, swollen cans) and noncritical violations (Food not protected during storage, preparation, display, transportation and service, from potential sources of contamination-food uncovered, mislabeled, stored on floor, missing or inadequate sneeze guards, food containers double stacked).<p>

<p>Throughout the 2973 Food Service Establishments data, 2600 of them had non-critical violations. There were 29 different non-critical violations found amongst the restaurants.<p>

<p>Examples of other noncritical violations are insects and rodents present, Miscellaneous, Economic Violation, Choking Poster, Training and Plumbing and sinks not properly sized, installed, maintained; equipment and floors not properly drained.<p> 

The most critical violations one restaurant faced was 5 while the most noncritical violations one restaurant faced was 20.
</p>

<p>But according to Sydney Zweibach she would prefer a restaurant to have multiple non-critical violations than one critical violation.  “I would be more concerned about clean food than floors that are dirty,” Zweibach said.<p>

        <p> All of the Food Service Establishments and Schools K-12 Food Services included in the data are all currently operating. The given data was collected between 1995 and 2024 and allows us to analyze food service facilities to inform people if restaurants have any health violations against them, so once aware they can decide if they want to try it or go back.</p>
